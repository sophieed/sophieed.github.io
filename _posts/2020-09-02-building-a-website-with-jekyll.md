**So... I have a website now.** I had a week of work and largely spent it building a website. Once a coder, always a coder.

My site is built on Jekyll. Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator written in Ruby: it is free, open source, and right up my street.

I decided to use Jekyll for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it is hugely flexible, and affords essentially _full control_ over how the site looks and feels (unlike me, who looks tired and feels hungry). It supports JavaScript to create responsive, interactive elements, and Liquid programming to load dynamic content.  Every aspect of the site is modifiable, and it is relatively straightforward to build a new site from the ground up. Doing so can result in incredibly code-light sites without all of the pre-assembled crap that comes bundled into many blogging platforms and content management systems: you are the expert in how your site works, because you gave birth to it.

Alternatively - if you don't feel like pushing out a 7lb 6oz website while screaming at your husband - the highly active Jekyll community have produced _thousands_ of site templates, which can be picked apart and modified to your exact requirements. The world is your proverbial oyster.

Another major factor in my decision to create a site through Jekyll is that _static_ sites are both fast and secure. This is largely down to there being no underlying database. Instead, the site consists of pre-rendered, static html pages, and all the server has to do is present these files: no database querying or dynamic content creation required. The hard work has already been done! The same html is then served to anyone visiting your site from anywhere in the world (_oh hey, all you bots from China! I see you guys! Best wishes. Warmest regards_). 

Long story short, this makes the site pretty zippy.

The lack of database also makes the site essentially unhackable (ok, but don't try to hack me to prove a point please, that would be kinda mean). There is no database to corrupt, no data collected, no server patches to stay up-to-date with. There are no requests being sent, and the site is not susceptible to brute-force attacks. Shibby!

Jekyll is also super cheap, and I have no money (help me I'm poor). Jekyll sites can be hosted for free on GitHub pages. There is excellent built-in support for deploying your site straight from the repository, and it doesn't cost a penny. I decided to buy a custom domain name, but fortunately sophieedgarandrews.com wasn't _in demand_ (surprising that) so cost next to nothing too.

Finally, I decided to use Jekyll because of the great community. Now hear me out, I'm not gonna get all soppy and heartwarming on you.... Jekyll is _so_ widely used that chances are, if there's something you wanna do, someone else has already done it before. That means there is an absolute wealth of online resources, tutorials, and Q&As covering just about anything you could possibly want to include in your site. That is *incredibly* helpful when it comes to coding without falling into the inevitable rabbit-hole of "why won't this button work? what is the syntax? is there no God?!" I can't thank Stack Overflow enough.

Anyway, thus concludes my reasoning for using Jekyll. Over the coming weeks, I will probably end up writing a few posts on what I've learned during this (ongoing) process.

Over and out.
