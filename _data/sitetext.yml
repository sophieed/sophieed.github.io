    text: "Hi, I'm Sophie. <br> <br>

    I am an experienced data science and technology consultant, specialising in
    the biomedical and public health sector.<br><br>

    After completing my DPhil (PhD) in Infection, Immunology, and Translational Medicine
    at The University of Oxford in 2016, I worked as a postdoctoral research fellow in viral
    immunology, investigating immune evasion in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection. Pursuing my passion for
    coding and data, I subsequently worked for an internationally renowned
    FinTech company, developing and deploying high-performance software solutions. <br><br>

    In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic abruptly and profoundly changed the world we live in. While the
    acute effects of the pandemic can still be felt, the long-standing impacts on society, health, and
    business remain difficult to predict. <br><br>

    With a strong background in viral immunology, data science, and software engineering, I am uniquely
    placed to support your business in our evolving and uncertain world. I offer a range of freelance
    consultancy services, and would love to hear about your ideas.<br><br>

    I'm also a mum, a forager, and a really good cook."
