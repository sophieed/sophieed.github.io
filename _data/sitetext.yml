    text: "Hi, I'm Sophie. <br> <br>

    I am an experienced viral immunologist and data scientist, working in the public health&nbsp;sector.<br><br>

    After completing my DPhil (PhD) in Infection, Immunology, and Translational Medicine
    at The University of Oxford in 2016, I worked as a postdoctoral research fellow in viral
    immunology, investigating immune evasion in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection. Pursuing my passion for
    coding and data, I subsequently worked for an internationally renowned
    FinTech company, developing and deploying high-performance software&nbsp;solutions. <br><br>

    In March 2020, COVID-19 abruptly and profoundly changed the world we live in. I 
    worked as a consultant to the World Health Organization during the early stages of the pandemic, before 
    taking on my current role as Head of Thematic Assessment with the UK Health Security Agency. While the
    effects of the pandemic can still be felt, the long-standing impacts on society, health, and
    business remain difficult to&nbsp;predict. <br><br>

    With a strong background in data science, immunology, and software engineering, I am uniquely
    placed to support your business in our evolving and uncertain world. I offer a range of freelance
    consultancy services, and would love to hear about your&nbsp;ideas.<br><br>

    I'm also a mum, a forager, and a really good&nbsp;cook.<br><br>
