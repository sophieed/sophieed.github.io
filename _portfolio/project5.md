First author study describing the role of antibodies on driving HIV evolution.<br>

The HIV-1 envelope mutates rapidly to evade recognition and killing, and is a major target of humoral immune responses and vaccine development. 
We studied HIV-1 envelope evolution in a narrow-source cohort of former plasma donors, with the aim of identifying common antibody epitopes under immune selection.
We identified several sites under significant immunological pressure in a majority of patients. If verified in functional studies, such epitopes could be suitable as targets in vaccine development.
