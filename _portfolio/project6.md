Joint first author study describing the crystal structure of the HIV-2 Nef protein.<br>

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) accessory protein Nef plays a major role in establishing and 
maintaining infection, particularly through immune evasion. Here we reported the crystal structure of 
the HIV-2 Nef core, providing insights into the distinct pathogenesis of HIV-2 infection.
