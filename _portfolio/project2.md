First author review article describing the recent advances in understanding HIV evolution.<br>

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) evolves rapidly owing to the
combined activity of error-prone reverse transcriptase, recombination, and
short generation times, leading to extensive viral diversity both within and
between hosts. This diversity is a major contributing factor in the failure of
the immune system to eradicate the virus and has important implications for
the development of suitable drugs and vaccines to combat infection. This
review discusses the recent technological advances that have shed light
on HIV evolution and summarises emerging concepts in the field.
