The COVID-19 Explorer App combines COVID-19 cases and deaths reported to the World Health Organization with publicly available data on testing, population mobility, and response, with the aim to provide rapid access to commonly requested data visualisations and analyses. It is primarily targeted at technical users in public health and academia, complementing information shared through the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard.<br>

The app is built with Shiny: a powerful framework for developing interactive web applications using R.
