First author textbook chapter describing the role of the cellular immune response in HIV infection.<br>

T-cells play a central role in both the control and pathogenesis of HIV infection. While T-cell responses against HIV-1 infection have been studied in great detail, 
much less is known about T-cells in the context of HIV-2. This textbook chapter summarizes current understanding of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics 
of HIV-2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses, highlighting key areas in which they may differ from responses against HIV-1, and the clinical implications of such 
disparities.
