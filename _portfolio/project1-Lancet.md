First author review article on the development of a vaccine against serogroup B *Neisseria meningitidis*: an important cause of invasive bacterial infection in children worldwide. <br>
We discuss the pros and cons of the vaccine and conclude that for parents and clinicians treating individual patients, the predicted benefits of vaccination outweigh existing uncertainties if any cases can be prevented, but future use of the vaccine must be followed by rigorous post-implementation surveillance to reassess its value to health systems with directly recorded epidemiological data.
