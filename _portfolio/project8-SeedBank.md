SeedBank is a Java application for storing and managing information about packets of seeds (I'm super into growing my own food. What else do you wanna know about me...?)<br>

SeedBank is a Maven project using the Spring Boot framework, and a MySQL database to store the underlying data. It is very much a work in progress, being developed purely because it is useful to me personally. However, the code is available on GitHub, and eventually I will produce some more comprehensive documentation about how to get it up and running locally. It's quite niche as a concept, and so I haven't spent a huge amount of time getting it "production ready".
